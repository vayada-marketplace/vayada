"""Guest-initiated booking change request flow (VAY-379).

Guests can ask to amend a confirmed booking — change dates, add or
remove add-ons, tweak add-on quantities/dates. The change does NOT
apply immediately: a row is written to ``booking_change_requests`` and
the host gets an email with approve/decline buttons (also accessible
from the PMS booking detail page). The booking row only mutates once
the host approves.

Pricing rules:
- Reuses the same primitives as ``booking_service`` so the diff the
  guest sees matches what they'd pay if they re-booked: stay pricing
  + add-on total + promo discount + last-minute discount remain locked
  to their original-booking values (we don't re-apply promo on a change;
  we don't re-resolve last-minute discounts).
- Price-reducing changes are blocked when the booking is already paid
  (status ``captured``/``refunded`` etc.). Pay-at-property and
  awaiting-transfer bookings can still change in either direction.

Concurrency:
- A ``UNIQUE INDEX … WHERE status = 'pending'`` on
  ``booking_change_requests`` enforces "one pending request per
  booking" at the DB level. Submitting while another is pending
  raises ``ValueError``.
