# Backend Migration

`@vayada/backend-migration` owns target-schema migrations, local fixture
rebuilds, source-to-target transforms, and parity checks for the TypeScript
backend rewrite.

## Full-Fixture Smoke

Use the full-fixture smoke command after updating `main` and before marking
post-merge migration fixture coverage as accepted:

```bash
TARGET_DATABASE_URL=<local scratch target database> \
  npm --workspace @vayada/backend-migration run target:fixtures:smoke
```

The command runs every fixture case registered in `src/cases/registry.ts`. For
each case it drops and recreates the target schemas, applies all reviewed target
migrations, loads that fixture, runs its transform when one is registered, and
then runs parity checks against `expected-target.json`.

`target:fixtures:smoke` intentionally does not accept `--fixtures`; it is the
full accepted fixture matrix. Use `target:rebuild` and `target:parity` directly
when you need to debug a single fixture case.

The unit tests compare fixture manifests, registry entries, and the smoke case
list. Adding a fixture manifest without registering it, or changing the smoke
path so it omits a registered case, fails `npm test`.
