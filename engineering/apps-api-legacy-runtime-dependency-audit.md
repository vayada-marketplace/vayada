# apps/api legacy runtime dependency audit

_VAY-760 decision record. Complements the route-surface inventory in
`booking-pms-route-migration-inventory.md` and the marketplace route order in
`marketplace-route-migration-inventory.md`._

## Decision

`apps/api` must reach the staging rehearsal with no runtime dependency on
legacy product databases or legacy Python APIs. Until then, the current
compatibility wiring remains acceptable only as a dark migration bridge:
contracts can be implemented behind the same HTTP shape, but activation waits
for the one-time legacy-to-target migration and cutover window.

`AUTH_LEGACY_MARKETPLACE_JWT_SECRET` is intentionally excluded from this audit.
Its retirement is owned by the WorkOS rollout plan in
`workos-rollout-configuration.md`. All other legacy product DB connection
strings and legacy product API URLs in `apps/api/src/config.ts` are in scope.
`BOOKING_HOST_BASE` and `MARKETPLACE_DISCOVERY_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` are support
configuration for generated URLs/CORS and are not legacy runtime dependencies;
they can remain after the legacy DB/API removals if the target routes still
need those deployment-specific values.

## Replacement order

1. **Marketplace discovery read path** (`MARKETPLACE_DATABASE_URL`).
   This is already contract-first and read-only. Finish the production data path
   so public discovery can be served from the target marketplace read model
   without a legacy marketplace runtime DB connection.

2. **Public profile and Booking Web host read path** (`BOOKING_DATABASE_URL`).
   Replace `createPgPublicHotelProfileRepository` with a target public profile
   repository. This unblocks AI profile, Booking Web profile, and host
   resolution from the same canonical projection.

3. **Public quote, offers, and calendar reads** (`PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL` read
   calls).
   Replace PMS room/unavailable-date HTTP calls with target distribution and
   bookability read models. This must follow the public profile work because
   quote and calendar responses depend on canonical hotel slug, currency,
   locale, booking URL, and policy data.

4. **Booking settings target repository** (`BOOKING_DATABASE_URL` reads and
   writes).
   Implement target read/write ownership behind the existing contracts, but keep
   writes pointed at legacy until the cutover window because legacy services
   still read `booking_hotels`.

5. **Guest-form settings PMS sync removal** (`PMS_API_URL`).
   After target settings are the shared source, PMS guest-form/check-in flows
   must consume the target read model. The PATCH sync is then removed rather
   than redirected.

6. **Booking reservations read model** (`BOOKING_RESERVATIONS_READ_DATABASE_URL`).
   Replace the compatibility PMS query with a target reservation read repository.
   This depends on booking/checkout and PMS operations migration parity because
   the current projection joins booking, room type, room assignment, payment,
   add-on, and change/guest status fields.

7. **Booking Web checkout and guest commands** (`PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL` command
   calls and `BOOKING_WEB_LEGACY_CHECKOUT_COMMAND_PROXY_ENABLED`).
   Move booking create, authorization confirmation, lookup/status, guest
   cancel/withdraw/change-request, and payment-instruction behavior into target
   booking/checkout handlers with PMS reservation handoff and audit/idempotency.
   This is the highest-risk write surface and should be activated only during
   the rehearsal-backed cutover sequence.

8. **Affiliate public Booking Web proxies** (`PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL` affiliate
   calls).
   VAY-768 decides ownership: marketplace/affiliate target services own public
   registration, email checks, referral identity, and lifecycle state; finance
   owns Stripe Connect/onboarding. Booking Web keeps only the public
   compatibility facade while its referral modal remains live.

9. **Booking public API leftovers** (`BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL` promo,
   custom-domain, telemetry).
   Replace promo/custom-domain behavior in the target services and retire the
   telemetry forwarder once platform event intake is the only dashboard source.

## Cutover-day activation

Follow-up implementations must introduce or confirm these activation knobs
before legacy env vars are removed. Names below are proposed contract names;
implementation tickets can rename them, but each surface needs an equivalent
explicit switch and startup assertion.

The staging rehearsal should prove the same steps against a migrated snapshot
before production:

1. Deploy target-backed repositories and adapters dark with legacy env vars
   still configured.
2. Run the final legacy-to-target migration and parity checks.
3. Freeze or queue legacy writes for the cutover window.
4. Flip marketplace discovery to the target DB; remove `MARKETPLACE_DATABASE_URL`.
5. Flip public profile / Booking Web host reads to the target DB; remove the
   public-profile use of `BOOKING_DATABASE_URL`.
6. Flip quote, offer, and calendar reads to target read models; remove read use
   of `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
7. Flip Booking settings writes to target after the final settings snapshot is
   migrated. Remove settings use of `BOOKING_DATABASE_URL`.
8. Point PMS/check-in consumers at target guest-form settings. Remove
   `PMS_API_URL` from `apps/api`.
9. Flip reservation list reads to the target repository. Remove
   `BOOKING_RESERVATIONS_READ_DATABASE_URL`.
10. Enable target checkout/guest command handlers. Remove
    `BOOKING_WEB_LEGACY_CHECKOUT_COMMAND_PROXY_ENABLED` and remaining
    command-path use of `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
11. Flip or retire affiliate public routes and the remaining
    `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL` promo/domain/telemetry paths.
12. Start `apps/api` with no legacy product DB URLs and no legacy product API
    URLs configured. The app must still mount all accepted replacement
    contracts needed for frontend and public traffic.

## Follow-up implementation tickets

These scopes are ready to create once this decision record is accepted:

1. **Replace marketplace discovery runtime DB dependency**
   - Route `/api/marketplace/listings` and `/api/marketplace/creators` to the
     accepted target marketplace read model / scheduled refresh path.
   - Validation: marketplace discovery contract tests pass with no
     `MARKETPLACE_DATABASE_URL`.

2. **Add target public hotel profile repository**
   - Replace `createPgPublicHotelProfileRepository` behind AI profile and
     Booking Web host/profile routes.
   - Validation: profile and host-resolution parity fixtures pass for known
     subdomain and custom-domain hotels.

3. **Add target public quote and calendar read repositories**
   - Replace PMS public rooms and unavailable-date calls with distribution
     read models.
   - Validation: public bookability fixtures cover available, sold-out,
     invalid request, stale data, and unavailable data cases.

4. **Add target Booking settings read/write repository**
   - Implement add-on, guest-form, benefits, localization, and room-filter
     settings against target schema behind the existing route contracts.
   - Validation: existing settings contract tests pass against target fixtures;
     cutover notes state when writes flip.

5. **Remove PMS guest-form settings sync**
   - Make PMS/check-in settings consumers read the target settings projection
     and delete `createHttpPmsGuestFormSettingsSync`.
   - Validation: guest-form settings write no longer depends on `PMS_API_URL`;
     PMS guest-form behavior has parity coverage.

6. **Add target Booking reservations read repository**
   - Replace the compatibility PMS SQL query with a target read model preserving
     current list filters and response fields.
   - Validation: reservation list contract tests pass against migrated snapshot
     fixtures, including room assignments and payment/add-on fields.

7. **Move Booking Web checkout commands to target handlers**
   - Implement checkout config, create, confirm authorization, status, lookup,
     withdraw, cancel, change-request, payment-instructions, and promo flows
     without `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL` / `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
   - Validation: Booking Web public parity tests pass with the legacy command
     proxy disabled and no legacy public API URLs.

8. **Implement Booking Web affiliate route ownership**
   - Port check-email/register to target marketplace/affiliate ownership and
     Stripe Connect link creation to finance ownership behind
     `AFFILIATE_PUBLIC_SOURCE=target`; keep `/api/booking-web/hotels/:slug/attribution/clicks`
     on the target event sink in the same gate, and keep route retirement only
     for a later product decision that removes the Booking Web referral modal.
   - Validation: accepted owner has route contract tests, click attribution
     persists to the target event store with legacy forwarding disabled, and no
     PMS proxy remains.

9. **Retire legacy Booking public domain and telemetry bridges**
   - Replace `/api/resolve-domain` compatibility with target domain
     verification and remove best-effort `/api/events` forwarding.
   - Validation: custom-domain host resolution and dashboard telemetry use
     target services only.
