# PMS Reservation Integration Contract

_VAY-641 contract record. Builds on
`engineering/booking-pms-domain-boundaries.md`, VAY-639, and the TypeScript
backend rewrite contracts._

## Purpose

Booking Engine must be able to hand a confirmed direct booking to Vayada PMS,
Guesty, Lodgify, Hostaway, or another PMS without making Booking Engine depend
on any one PMS schema or API.

This contract defines the Vayada-owned boundary for that handoff. It is not a
concrete adapter implementation and it does not change current Python PMS or
Channex behavior before a reviewed cutover.

## Boundary

Owner package:

- `domain-pms` owns operational reservation contracts and PMS adapter ports.

Consumers:

- `domain-booking` may call the reservation sink interface after it has created
  or changed a guest-facing direct booking.
- PMS admin/calendar surfaces may read operational reservation state through the
  read interface.
- Jobs/events may retry handoffs and record provider outcomes.

Non-consumers:

- Booking Engine routes must not call Vayada PMS tables, Channex tables,
  `PMS_DATABASE_URL`, or provider-specific PMS clients directly.
- Booking Web public flows must not call PMS public routes directly in the
  TypeScript target path. They call Booking/checkout lifecycle routes and
  Distribution/bookability read routes as defined by
  `engineering/booking-web-public-api-routing.md`.
- Channex remains PMS-owned channel connectivity. Booking Engine never calls
  Channex as part of this contract.

## Language Split

| Term                                | Owner          | Meaning                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `guestBookingId`                    | Booking Engine | Vayada guest-facing direct booking identity. Used in guest emails, checkout, and lookup flows.  |
| `pmsReservationRef`                 | PMS adapter    | Opaque reference to an operational reservation in Vayada PMS or an external PMS.                |
| `operationalReservationId`          | PMS operations | Vayada internal operational reservation identity when the PMS implementation is Vayada-owned.   |
| `externalReservationId`             | PMS adapter    | Provider-native reservation ID. Opaque to Booking Engine.                                       |
| `channelReservationRef`             | PMS operations | OTA/channel reservation identity, when the reservation originated from Channex or another feed. |
| `propertyId`                        | Hotel catalog  | Canonical Vayada property identity. Adapter implementations map this to provider properties.    |
| `pmsPropertyRef` / `pmsRoomTypeRef` | PMS adapter    | Provider-native property, unit, room-type, or rate-plan references. Opaque outside the adapter. |

Booking Engine may store `pmsReservationRef` and provider name as opaque values
for status display and retries. It must not parse provider IDs or infer
operational state from provider-specific formats.

## Contract Version

Every command and result carries:

```ts
type PmsReservationContractVersion = "pms-reservation.v1";
```

Breaking changes require a new version. Additive fields are allowed when they
are documented here first and adapter behavior remains backward compatible.

## Shared Types

```ts
type PmsProviderKey = "vayada_pms" | "guesty" | "lodgify" | "hostaway" | "custom";

type PmsCapability =
  | "create_reservation"
  | "update_stay_dates"
  | "update_guest_details"
  | "update_room_type"
  | "cancel_reservation"
  | "read_operational_reservation"
  | "read_inventory_assignments";

type PmsConnectionStatus =
  | "connected"
  | "disconnected"
  | "suspended"
  | "degraded"
  | "setup_incomplete";

type PmsReservationStatus =
  | "pending_handoff"
  | "confirmed"
  | "modified"
  | "cancelled"
  | "checked_in"
  | "in_house"
  | "checked_out"
  | "no_show"
  | "failed";

type PmsCurrencyCode = string;
type PmsDecimalAmount = string;
type PmsDate = string;
type PmsUtcDateTime = string;

type PmsMoney = {
  amountDecimal: PmsDecimalAmount;
  currency: PmsCurrencyCode;
};

type PmsAuditContext = {
  requestId: string;
  correlationId: string;
  causationId?: string;
  organizationId: string;
  propertyId: string;
  actorType: "guest" | "hotel_user" | "system" | "platform_admin";
  actorId?: string;
  source: "booking_engine" | "pms_admin" | "job_retry" | "migration" | "test";
  occurredAt: PmsUtcDateTime;
};

type PmsExternalReference = {
  provider: PmsProviderKey;
  connectionId: string;
  externalReservationId?: string;
  externalPropertyId?: string;
  externalRoomTypeId?: string;
  externalRatePlanId?: string;
  opaqueProviderData?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
};
```

Scalar format rules:

- `PmsCurrencyCode` must be an ISO-4217 uppercase three-letter code, for example
  `"EUR"` or `"USD"`.
- `PmsDecimalAmount` is a base-10 decimal string in major units, for example
  `"120.50"`. It must not use floating point JSON numbers, exponential
  notation, thousands separators, or currency symbols.
- Monetary values must be rounded before serialization using the currency minor
  unit for the target `PmsCurrencyCode` unless a field explicitly documents a
  different precision. For standard currencies this means `"120.50"` for EUR and
  `"120"` for JPY.
- Negative money is forbidden unless the field explicitly allows it. Discounts,
  refunds, and penalties are represented as positive amounts in their own typed
  fields.
- `PmsDate` must be an ISO calendar date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- `PmsUtcDateTime` must be an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp with a trailing `Z`, for
  example `"2026-06-05T14:16:42.000Z"`.
- Adapters must validate these scalar formats before persisting commands or
  comparing idempotency payloads. Invalid scalars return `VALIDATION_FAILED`
  before any provider call.

`opaqueProviderData` is adapter-owned metadata for diagnostics and retries. It
must not be required by Booking Engine business logic.

## Reservation Sink Port

The sink port is the only synchronous application boundary Booking Engine may
call for guest-visible reservation handoff.

```ts
interface PmsReservationSink {
  createReservation(command: CreatePmsReservationCommand): Promise<PmsReservationHandoffResult>;

  updateReservation(command: UpdatePmsReservationCommand): Promise<PmsReservationHandoffResult>;

  cancelReservation(command: CancelPmsReservationCommand): Promise<PmsReservationHandoffResult>;
}
```

Implementations may complete synchronously or accept the command for async
processing. A synchronous return of `accepted` means the command is durably
recorded and retryable; it does not mean the external PMS already confirmed the
change.

## Create Command

```ts
type CreatePmsReservationCommand = {
  contractVersion: "pms-reservation.v1";
  commandId: string;
  idempotencyKey: string;
  audit: PmsAuditContext;
  target: {
    propertyId: string;
    provider: PmsProviderKey;
    connectionId: string;
    requiredCapabilities: ["create_reservation"];
  };
  guestBooking: {
    guestBookingId: string;
    bookingReference: string;
    status: "confirmed";
    createdAt: PmsUtcDateTime;
    source: "direct_booking";
    locale: string;
  };
  stay: {
    checkInDate: PmsDate;
    checkOutDate: PmsDate;
    adults: number;
    children: number;
    numberOfRooms: number;
    estimatedArrivalTime?: string | null;
    specialRequests?: string | null;
  };
  guests: {
    primary: PmsGuest;
    additional?: PmsGuest[];
  };
  bookedOffer: {
    roomTypeId: string;
    ratePlanId?: string | null;
    roomName: string;
    roomTypeExternalRef?: PmsExternalReference;
    ratePlanExternalRef?: PmsExternalReference;
  };
  pricing: {
    roomTotal: PmsMoney;
    taxesAndFees?: PmsMoney;
    discounts?: PmsMoney;
    addonsTotal?: PmsMoney;
    grandTotal: PmsMoney;
  };
  payment: {
    paymentStatus: "unpaid" | "authorized" | "partially_paid" | "paid";
    paymentMethod?: "card" | "pay_at_property" | "bank_transfer" | "other";
    depositAmount?: PmsMoney;
    balanceAmount?: PmsMoney;
    providerPaymentRef?: string;
  };
  policy: {
    cancellationPolicyId?: string;
    cancellationSummary?: string;
    refundableUntil?: PmsUtcDateTime | null;
  };
};

type PmsGuest = {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email?: string | null;
  phone?: string | null;
  country?: string | null;
  dateOfBirth?: PmsDate | null;
};
```

Create commands should be emitted only after Booking Engine has committed the
guest-facing booking. The PMS handoff must not be the source of truth for
whether checkout succeeded.

## Update Command

```ts
type UpdatePmsReservationCommand = {
  contractVersion: "pms-reservation.v1";
  commandId: string;
  idempotencyKey: string;
  audit: PmsAuditContext;
  target: {
    propertyId: string;
    provider: PmsProviderKey;
    connectionId: string;
    pmsReservationRef: string;
    requiredCapabilities: PmsCapability[];
  };
  guestBooking: {
    guestBookingId: string;
    bookingReference: string;
  };
  changes: {
    stay?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["stay"]>;
    guests?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["guests"]>;
    bookedOffer?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["bookedOffer"]>;
    pricing?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["pricing"]>;
    payment?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["payment"]>;
    policy?: Partial<CreatePmsReservationCommand["policy"]>;
  };
  expectedPreviousVersion?: string;
};
```

Adapters must reject unsupported partial changes with
`UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`. Booking Engine should then choose a product-visible
fallback, such as a manual review state, instead of reaching around the
adapter.

## Cancel Command

```ts
type CancelPmsReservationCommand = {
  contractVersion: "pms-reservation.v1";
  commandId: string;
  idempotencyKey: string;
  audit: PmsAuditContext;
  target: {
    propertyId: string;
    provider: PmsProviderKey;
    connectionId: string;
    pmsReservationRef: string;
    requiredCapabilities: ["cancel_reservation"];
  };
  guestBooking: {
    guestBookingId: string;
    bookingReference: string;
  };
  cancellation: {
    reason:
      | "guest_requested"
      | "hotel_declined"
      | "payment_failed"
      | "no_show"
      | "platform_action"
      | "other";
    cancelledAt: PmsUtcDateTime;
    penaltyAmount?: PmsMoney;
    refundAmount?: PmsMoney;
    note?: string;
  };
};
```

Cancellation commands describe the Booking Engine outcome. A PMS adapter may
map that to a provider-specific cancellation, but Booking Engine must not depend
on provider-specific cancellation reason codes.

## Handoff Result

```ts
type PmsReservationHandoffResult = {
  contractVersion: "pms-reservation.v1";
  commandId: string;
  idempotencyKey: string;
  outcome: "succeeded" | "accepted" | "duplicate_replayed" | "noop" | "failed";
  guestBookingId: string;
  pmsReservationRef?: string;
  operationalReservationId?: string;
  externalReference?: PmsExternalReference;
  status?: PmsReservationStatus;
  providerVersion?: string;
  providerRequestId?: string;
  auditEventId: string;
  retryAfter?: string;
  error?: PmsReservationError;
};
```

Result rules:

- `succeeded` means the PMS operation is confirmed.
- `accepted` means a durable job/outbox record exists and will drive the
  provider call.
- `duplicate_replayed` means the same idempotency key and payload already
  produced this result.
- `noop` means the requested state already exists.
- `failed` must include a typed `PmsReservationError`.

## Error Contract

```ts
type PmsReservationError = {
  code:
    | "PMS_DISCONNECTED"
    | "UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY"
    | "DUPLICATE_RESERVATION"
    | "MAPPING_MISSING"
    | "RETRYABLE_INTEGRATION_FAILURE"
    | "IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT"
    | "VALIDATION_FAILED"
    | "CONFLICT"
    | "PROVIDER_REJECTED";
  retryable: boolean;
  userVisibleCategory:
    | "manual_review_required"
    | "temporary_unavailable"
    | "configuration_required"
    | "already_exists"
    | "invalid_request";
  sanitizedMessage: string;
  providerStatusCode?: number;
  providerErrorCode?: string;
  providerRequestId?: string;
};
```

Required states:

| Code                            | Retryable | Meaning                                                                                  | Expected handling                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PMS_DISCONNECTED`              | No        | No active PMS connection exists for the property.                                        | Put booking into manual PMS follow-up; surface setup issue to hotel/admin.      |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY`        | No        | Adapter cannot perform the requested create/update/cancel capability.                    | Use manual review or product fallback; do not call provider internals directly. |
| `DUPLICATE_RESERVATION`         | No        | Provider reports an existing reservation for the same booking outside idempotent replay. | Link manually or reconcile through an audited repair flow.                      |
| `MAPPING_MISSING`               | No        | Required property, room type, rate plan, or guest-booking mapping is absent.             | Block handoff until setup or reconciliation creates the mapping.                |
| `RETRYABLE_INTEGRATION_FAILURE` | Yes       | Timeout, `429`, `5xx`, transient lock, or provider temporary outage.                     | Retry through jobs/events with the same idempotency key and correlation chain.  |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`          | No        | Same idempotency key was reused with a different payload.                                | Treat as a caller bug; create an audit event and reject.                        |
| `VALIDATION_FAILED`             | No        | Command is missing required contract data or violates date/guest/price rules.            | Reject before provider call when possible.                                      |
| `CONFLICT`                      | Maybe     | Provider state conflicts with expected previous version or current reservation state.    | Retry only if adapter can prove the conflict is transient.                      |
| `PROVIDER_REJECTED`             | No        | Provider rejected a valid command for a business reason.                                 | Preserve sanitized reason and move to manual review.                            |

Provider raw errors, credentials, card data, and full PII payloads must not be
stored in `sanitizedMessage`.

## Idempotency

Every create/update/cancel command must include an idempotency key.

Recommended key format:

```text
pms.reservation.<operation>:property:<propertyId>:booking:<guestBookingId>:<semanticVersion>
```

Examples:

- `pms.reservation.create:property:prop_alpenrose:booking:book_123:v1`
- `pms.reservation.update:property:prop_alpenrose:booking:book_123:dates-v2`
- `pms.reservation.cancel:property:prop_alpenrose:booking:book_123:v1`

Rules:

- Same key + same normalized payload returns the existing active or completed
  result.
- Same key + different normalized payload returns `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.
- Retries reuse the same key and append attempts.
- Intentional new changes use a new semantic version.
- Provider-native idempotency keys may be derived from the Vayada key, but the
  Vayada key remains the audit source of truth.

All adapters must use the same canonicalization algorithm before comparing
payloads for replay versus `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`:

```ts
type CanonicalJsonValue =
  | null
  | boolean
  | string
  | number
  | CanonicalJsonValue[]
  | { [key: string]: CanonicalJsonValue };

function canonicalizePayloadForIdempotency(command: unknown): string;
```

`canonicalizePayloadForIdempotency` rules:

- Drop object properties whose value is `undefined`; an absent optional field and
  an explicitly `undefined` field are the same.
- Preserve explicit `null` values.
- Deep-sort object keys lexicographically at every object level.
- Preserve array order exactly. Array order is semantic for guests, rooms,
  add-ons, and provider references.
- Serialize money only through `PmsMoney.amountDecimal` after enforcing the
  scalar rules above; do not serialize floating point money.
- Canonicalize decimal strings by removing a leading `+`, removing unnecessary
  leading zeros, and keeping the currency minor-unit scale required for that
  field. For example EUR `"00120.5"` serializes as `"120.50"`.
- Canonicalize all timestamps to `PmsUtcDateTime` with millisecond precision and
  trailing `Z`.
- Canonicalize all dates to `PmsDate`.
- Serialize the resulting value with a stable JSON encoder equivalent to
  `stableStringify`, without whitespace.

Adapters must store the canonical payload string or its cryptographic digest
next to the idempotency key. Replay comparison is based on that canonical value,
not on provider-native payload bytes.

## Audit and Correlation

Every command must create or link:

- a durable command/outbox record;
- a product audit event with actor, organization, property, guest booking, PMS
  provider, command ID, idempotency key, request ID, and correlation ID;
- sanitized provider attempt records when an external PMS call is attempted;
- final handoff status visible to Booking Engine and PMS admin surfaces.

Guest-visible handoffs must be auditable even when an adapter completes
synchronously. There must be no untracked fire-and-forget PMS handoff.

## Operational Reservation Read Port

PMS admin/calendar surfaces should read operational reservation state through a
PMS-owned interface. They must not read Booking Engine internals directly.

```ts
interface PmsOperationalReservationReadPort {
  getOperationalReservation(
    query: GetPmsOperationalReservationQuery,
  ): Promise<PmsOperationalReservationReadModel | null>;

  listOperationalReservations(
    query: ListPmsOperationalReservationsQuery,
  ): Promise<PmsOperationalReservationListResult>;
}

type RequireAtLeastOne<T, Keys extends keyof T = keyof T> = Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, Keys>> &
  {
    [K in Keys]-?: Required<Pick<T, K>> & Partial<Pick<T, Exclude<Keys, K>>>;
  }[Keys];

type GetPmsOperationalReservationQuery = { propertyId: string } & RequireAtLeastOne<{
  pmsReservationRef?: string;
  operationalReservationId?: string;
  guestBookingId?: string;
}>;

type ListPmsOperationalReservationsQuery = {
  propertyId: string;
  dateRange: {
    from: PmsDate;
    to: PmsDate;
  };
  statuses?: PmsReservationStatus[];
  roomTypeId?: string;
  roomId?: string;
  source?: "direct_booking" | "channel" | "manual" | "imported";
  limit: number;
  offset: number;
};

type PmsOperationalReservationReadModel = {
  operationalReservationId?: string;
  pmsReservationRef: string;
  guestBookingId?: string;
  bookingReference?: string;
  propertyId: string;
  provider: PmsProviderKey;
  source: "direct_booking" | "channel" | "manual" | "imported";
  status: PmsReservationStatus;
  stay: {
    checkInDate: PmsDate;
    checkOutDate: PmsDate;
    adults: number;
    children: number;
  };
  assignment: {
    roomTypeId?: string;
    roomTypeName?: string;
    roomId?: string;
    roomNumber?: string;
    assignmentStatus: "unassigned" | "assigned" | "changed";
  };
  guestSummary: {
    displayName: string;
    email?: string | null;
    phone?: string | null;
  };
  financialSummary?: {
    total: PmsMoney;
    paid?: PmsMoney;
    balance?: PmsMoney;
  };
  externalReference?: PmsExternalReference;
  channelReservationRef?: string;
  lastSyncedAt?: PmsUtcDateTime;
  version?: string;
};

type PmsOperationalReservationListResult = {
  reservations: PmsOperationalReservationReadModel[];
  total: number;
  limit: number;
  offset: number;
};
```

The read model can include Booking Engine summary fields such as
`guestBookingId` and `bookingReference`, but those fields should come from a
permissioned read model or explicit integration event, not from PMS code opening
Booking Engine tables.

## Adapter Responsibilities

### Vayada PMS Adapter

The Vayada PMS adapter implements the same sink/read ports as every external
adapter. It may translate commands into Vayada operational reservation tables or
domain services, but that translation remains behind `domain-pms`.

The adapter must not leak Vayada PMS table names, SQL columns, or legacy PMS IDs
into Booking Engine contracts.

### External PMS Adapters

Guesty, Lodgify, Hostaway, and future adapters implement this contract by
mapping Vayada commands to provider APIs and mapping provider reservations back
to `PmsReservationHandoffResult` and `PmsOperationalReservationReadModel`.

Adapters must declare supported capabilities per connection. If a provider
cannot update stay dates, cancel reservations, or read assignments through API,
the adapter returns `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` instead of faking success.

### Test Fakes

Test fakes must implement the same interfaces and support:

- deterministic success, accepted, duplicate, noop, and failure outcomes;
- idempotency replay and conflict assertions;
- retryable failure simulation;
- disconnected/setup-incomplete provider state;
- mapping-missing scenarios;
- audit/correlation assertions.

Fakes should not expose helper-only behavior that real adapters cannot support.

## Channex Interaction

Channex integration stays behind PMS operations:

```text
Booking Engine
  -> PmsReservationSink
    -> Vayada PMS adapter or external PMS adapter
      -> PMS-owned channel connectivity / Channex jobs when applicable
```

Direct booking handoff may cause PMS-owned inventory or channel-sync events, but
Booking Engine only observes the PMS handoff result. It does not enqueue
Channex jobs or read Channex mappings.

## Implementation Follow-Ups

This contract enables implementation tickets without re-deciding the boundary:

- VAY-643 creates `packages/domain-pms` with these port and DTO types;
- VAY-644 creates a `packages/domain-booking` handoff service that emits
  `CreatePmsReservationCommand` after a guest booking commits;
- add test fakes for `PmsReservationSink` and
  `PmsOperationalReservationReadPort`;
- VAY-645 implements the Vayada PMS adapter behind the same interface;
- wire the VAY-639 Booking reservation read route to a Booking-owned read model
  or a PMS read adapter without direct PMS database access;
- extend `npm run check:architecture-boundaries` into package-level import
  boundaries under VAY-640.
