# Identity user-lifecycle commands

_VAY-656 contract record. Builds on VAY-600 WorkOS identity architecture,
VAY-608 RequestContext, VAY-609 target schema ownership, and the VAY-642
Booking/PMS coupling audit._

## Purpose

Product domains must not create, update, delete, suspend, or recover users by
writing `identity.users` or legacy Auth DB tables directly. Those writes are
identity-owned lifecycle commands. Product domains may request a lifecycle
change, but the identity/auth boundary owns the mutation, provider
reconciliation, organization membership changes, resource links, permission
grants, idempotency, and audit.

The TypeScript contract lives in `packages/backend-auth/src/lifecycle.ts` until
a dedicated `domain-identity` package exists. Product-facing TypeScript code
should depend on the command bus contract, not on raw Auth DB tables.

## Command Surface

| Command type                       | Identity-owned write intent                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `identity.user.create`             | Create an internal user, optional WorkOS mapping, initial organization, membership, permission intent, and resource links.     |
| `identity.user.profile.update`     | Update identity-owned profile cache fields such as display name. Product profile fields stay product-owned.                    |
| `identity.user.email.update`       | Change the local identity email cache and coordinate provider email verification/reconciliation.                               |
| `identity.user.status.update`      | Move the internal user between target statuses such as `pending`, `active`, `suspended`, and `deleted`.                        |
| `identity.user.suspend`            | Suspend a user and, when requested, suspend memberships/resource links so RequestContext resolution denies product access.     |
| `identity.user.delete`             | Soft-delete or privacy-erase identity state while preserving required audit and provider reconciliation records.               |
| `identity.access.grant`            | Grant or upsert an existing user's organization membership, resource links, and role permission grants.                        |
| `identity.access.revoke`           | Revoke or suspend an existing user's organization membership, resource links, and role permission grants.                      |
| `identity.recovery.flow.create`    | Start recovery, password reset, email verification, or email change through identity/provider flows, not product token tables. |
| `identity.invite.affiliate.create` | Invite or link an affiliate user through an affiliate-partner organization, membership, resource link, and permission grants.  |
| `identity.invite.customer.create`  | Invite a customer account without granting hotel ownership or staff membership. Guest booking data remains booking-owned.      |

Each accepted command emits an identity lifecycle event with the original
`commandId`, `idempotencyKey`, actor, reason, request/correlation metadata,
affected identity resources, and an event-specific payload. Product domains
react to events or command results; they do not patch identity rows themselves
or query identity tables to infer what changed.

## Audit And Idempotency

Every command must include:

- `commandId`: unique command identity for logs and event correlation.
- `idempotencyKey`: stable key from the product action, such as
  `affiliate:<affiliateId>:approved` or `booking-register:<email>`.
- `audit.actor`: user, system, or migration actor that requested the change.
- `audit.source`: route/source family (`web`, `admin`, `api`, `agent`, or
  `migration`).
- `audit.requestId` and optional `audit.correlationId`.
- `audit.reason`: human-readable business reason suitable for audit review.
- `audit.requestedAt`: timestamp from the command boundary.

Identity command handlers must treat the tuple
`(commandType, idempotencyKey)` as replay-safe. A retry can return
`idempotent_replay`, but it must not create duplicate users, memberships,
resource links, reset flows, or provider invites.

Recovery commands must name the recovery target at the contract boundary.
Password reset, account recovery, and email verification require either an
internal `userId` or an email address. Email change requires the current
internal `userId` and the requested `newEmail`.

## Ownership Mapping

| Current product write                                                                                           | Target replacement                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Booking registration inserts `auth-db.users` with `type = 'hotel'`, password hash, consent, and pending status. | `identity.user.create` creates a pending internal user, hotel-group organization, hotel-owner membership, and booking link.                                                            |
| Booking password reset and password change writes `password_reset_tokens` and `users.password_hash`.            | `identity.recovery.flow.create` delegates recovery/reset to identity/WorkOS and records reconciliation/audit events.                                                                   |
| Booking email change updates `users.email` after product token verification.                                    | `identity.user.email.update` coordinates provider verification and updates the identity email cache.                                                                                   |
| Marketplace registration/admin create inserts `auth-db.users` with creator, hotel, or admin type.               | `identity.user.create` plus organization/membership/resource links; user type becomes a migration input, not authorization.                                                            |
| Marketplace admin update mutates name, email, status, email verification, avatar, and `is_superadmin`.          | Profile/email/status commands plus `identity.access.grant` or `identity.access.revoke` for platform organization membership and permission grants. Avatar stays product/profile-owned. |
| Marketplace admin delete removes `auth-db.users` and product profiles in one product route.                     | `identity.user.delete` handles identity deletion; product domains handle their own profile/resource cleanup from events.                                                               |
| PMS affiliate approval inserts Auth users and `password_reset_tokens`, then links `affiliates.user_id`.         | `identity.invite.affiliate.create` creates or links an affiliate user, affiliate-partner membership, and affiliate resource.                                                           |
| Future customer account invitations from booking flows.                                                         | `identity.invite.customer.create`; no hotel ownership, staff membership, or resource-link grant is implied.                                                                            |

## Resource Ownership Rules

Identity lifecycle commands are the only target path that may create or update
identity ownership primitives:

- `organizations` for platform, hotel group, creator workspace, or affiliate
  partner tenants.
- `organization_memberships` for user-to-organization access.
- `role_permission_grants` or membership permission intent for product
  permissions such as `booking.settings.manage` or `affiliate.payout.manage`.
- `organization_resource_links` for booking hotels, PMS hotels, marketplace
  hotel profiles/listings, creator profiles, affiliates, and payout accounts.
  Revoking a resource link must include the relationship so identity can
  distinguish, for example, `owner`, `operator`, and `billing_account` links to
  the same resource.

Product tables may still keep legacy `user_id` columns as migration inputs or
compatibility fields until cutover, but target TypeScript routes and domain
services must authorize through RequestContext, membership permissions, and
resource links.

## Out Of Scope

This contract does not refactor the current Python auth repositories, change
WorkOS provider configuration, or migrate old password/TOTP/email-token tables.
Those legacy writes remain current-system behavior until their migration slices
land.
