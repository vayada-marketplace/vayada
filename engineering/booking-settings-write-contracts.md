# Booking settings write contracts

This document defines the typed write contracts for the Booking Flow settings
surfaces whose reads have already moved to typed contracts:

- [`BookingAddonSettings`](booking-addon-settings-contract.md)
- [`BookingGuestFormSettings`](booking-guest-form-settings-contract.md)
- [`BookingBenefitsSettings`](booking-benefits-settings-contract.md)
- [`BookingLocalizationSettings`](booking-localization-settings-contract.md)
- [`BookingRoomFilterSettings`](booking-room-filter-settings-contract.md)

The current booking-admin save paths still write through legacy admin endpoints
from `settingsService`. These contracts define the target TypeScript backend
write surface so follow-up tickets can implement routes, frontend clients, and
Booking Flow save migration without inventing payloads in code.

## Contract Shape

All five settings writes use full-surface replacement semantics:

| Field         | Value                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Method        | `PUT`                                                  |
| Path pattern  | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/<surface>`      |
| Route adapter | `registerBookingSettingsRoutes`                        |
| Success       | `200` with the normalized settings response            |
| Body          | Complete settings object for that surface, no partials |
| Query         | No public query parameters                             |

`hotelId` is the Booking product hotel id. It is the resource scope for the
settings row and every authorization check. Writes are idempotent: sending the
same body twice produces the same stored settings and response.

The write response shape for each surface matches its typed read response. The
frontend should update local state from the response instead of assuming the
submitted body is already normalized.

All write bodies are strict: unknown fields are rejected, required fields may
not be omitted, and `null` is invalid unless a future surface explicitly
documents a nullable field.

## Authorization

Every route is protected and must use `enforceRoutePolicy` at the route
boundary.

Required checks:

| Check                 | Contract value                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Permission            | `booking.settings.manage`                   |
| Entitlement           | active `booking:booking-engine`             |
| Entitlement resource  | `booking_hotel` with `resourceId = hotelId` |
| Linked resource       | `booking_hotel` with `resourceId = hotelId` |
| Allowed relationships | `owner`, `operator`                         |

Authentication failures return `401`. Permission, entitlement, inactive
entitlement, or linked-resource failures return `403`.

## Common Error Contract

```ts
type BookingSettingsWriteErrorCategory =
  | "authentication"
  | "authorization"
  | "validation"
  | "write_model";

type BookingSettingsWriteErrorCode =
  | "unauthenticated"
  | "missing_permission"
  | "missing_entitlement"
  | "inactive_entitlement"
  | "missing_resource_access"
  | "invalid_payload"
  | "not_found"
  | "write_model_unavailable";

type BookingSettingsWriteError = {
  statusCode: 401 | 403 | 404 | 422 | 500;
  code: BookingSettingsWriteErrorCode;
  category: BookingSettingsWriteErrorCategory;
  message: string;
  details?: unknown;
};
```

Expected mapping:

| Condition                         | Status | Code                      | Category         | Message                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Missing bearer/session            | `401`  | `unauthenticated`         | `authentication` | `A valid access token is required.`             |
| Invalid bearer/session            | `401`  | `unauthenticated`         | `authentication` | `A valid access token is required.`             |
| Missing permission                | `403`  | `missing_permission`      | `authorization`  | `Missing required booking settings permission.` |
| Missing entitlement               | `403`  | `missing_entitlement`     | `authorization`  | `Missing active booking engine entitlement.`    |
| Inactive entitlement              | `403`  | `inactive_entitlement`    | `authorization`  | `Booking engine entitlement is not active.`     |
| Missing linked-resource access    | `403`  | `missing_resource_access` | `authorization`  | `Missing booking hotel access.`                 |
| Hotel/settings row disappeared    | `404`  | `not_found`               | `write_model`    | `Booking settings target not found.`            |
| Invalid body shape or field value | `422`  | `invalid_payload`         | `validation`     | `Booking settings payload is invalid.`          |
| Repository/write-model error      | `500`  | `write_model_unavailable` | `write_model`    | `Booking settings could not be saved.`          |

Surface-specific clients may map these shared errors to more specific error
class names, but the wire format and status/category/code vocabulary should
stay common across the five write routes.

## Add-on Display Settings

| Field                  | Value                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path                   | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/addons`                             |
| Frontend client target | `updateBookingAddonSettings(input) -> BookingAddonSettings`                |
| Legacy write path      | `PATCH /admin/settings/addons` via `settingsService.updateAddonSettings()` |

```ts
type UpdateBookingAddonSettingsRequest = {
  params: { hotelId: string };
  query: Record<string, never>;
  body: {
    showAddonsStep: boolean;
    groupAddonsByCategory: boolean;
  };
};

type BookingAddonSettings = {
  showAddonsStep: boolean;
  groupAddonsByCategory: boolean;
};
```

Validation and behavior:

- Both booleans are required. Partial updates are not accepted by the typed
  route.
- `showAddonsStep: false` with `groupAddonsByCategory: true` is valid; guest
  checkout may ignore grouping while the add-ons step is hidden, but the setting
  remains persisted.
- The response returns the stored boolean values after normalization.
- This contract covers display settings only. Add-on CRUD remains on the
  existing add-on endpoints until a separate add-on management contract exists.

## Guest Form Settings

| Field                  | Value                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Path                   | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/guest-form`                                   |
| Frontend client target | `updateBookingGuestFormSettings(input) -> BookingGuestFormSettings`                  |
| Legacy write path      | `PATCH /admin/settings/property` plus best-effort `PATCH /admin/guest-form-settings` |

```ts
type UpdateBookingGuestFormSettingsRequest = {
  params: { hotelId: string };
  query: Record<string, never>;
  body: {
    specialRequestsEnabled: boolean;
    arrivalTimeEnabled: boolean;
    guestCountEnabled: boolean;
  };
};

type BookingGuestFormSettings = {
  specialRequestsEnabled: boolean;
  arrivalTimeEnabled: boolean;
  guestCountEnabled: boolean;
};
```

Validation and behavior:

- All three booleans are required. Partial updates are not accepted by the typed
  route.
- The Booking write is authoritative for this contract.
- Until the PMS guest-facing flow reads these flags from a Booking-owned or
  distribution-owned model, the typed route owns the existing compatibility
  sync to PMS. PMS sync failure is non-fatal and must not fail the request after
  the Booking write succeeds; it should be logged or emitted through the
  backend's operational telemetry.
- The response returns the Booking settings state, not PMS sync state.

## Benefits Settings

| Field                  | Value                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path                   | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/benefits`                  |
| Frontend client target | `updateBookingBenefitsSettings(input) -> BookingBenefitsSettings` |
| Legacy write path      | `PUT /admin/benefits` via `settingsService.updateBenefits()`      |

```ts
type UpdateBookingBenefitsSettingsRequest = {
  params: { hotelId: string };
  query: Record<string, never>;
  body: {
    benefits: string[];
  };
};

type BookingBenefitsSettings = {
  benefits: string[];
};
```

Validation and behavior:

- `benefits` is required and replaces the full hotel-level Book Direct Benefits
  list.
- Each item must be a string. The route trims leading/trailing whitespace.
- Empty strings after trimming are invalid.
- Duplicate benefit labels after trimming are invalid; the frontend should keep
  its current duplicate prevention.
- The route preserves order and custom owner-typed strings.
- The route does not translate, categorize, assign ids to, or sync benefits to
  PMS.

## Localization Settings

| Field                  | Value                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path                   | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/localization`                            |
| Frontend client target | `updateBookingLocalizationSettings(input) -> BookingLocalizationSettings`       |
| Legacy write path      | `PATCH /admin/settings/property` via `settingsService.updatePropertySettings()` |

```ts
type UpdateBookingLocalizationSettingsRequest = {
  params: { hotelId: string };
  query: Record<string, never>;
  body: {
    defaultCurrency: string;
    defaultLanguage: string;
    supportedCurrencies: string[];
    supportedLanguages: string[];
  };
};

type BookingLocalizationSettings = {
  defaultCurrency: string;
  defaultLanguage: string;
  supportedCurrencies: string[];
  supportedLanguages: string[];
};
```

Validation and behavior:

- All four fields are required. Partial updates are not accepted by the typed
  route.
- Currency codes are trimmed, uppercased, and must be three ASCII letters.
- Language codes are trimmed and must be non-empty BCP-47-style strings made of
  letters, digits, and hyphen separators.
- `supportedCurrencies` and `supportedLanguages` are additional selectable
  options. If either array contains the default value after normalization, the
  route drops that duplicate default from the array instead of storing it twice.
- Duplicate supported codes after normalization are invalid.
- The response returns normalized currency/language strings.
- Header currency-switcher writes and setup-wizard localization writes remain
  on their existing legacy paths until separate contracts migrate those
  workflows.

## Room Filter Settings

| Field                  | Value                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path                   | `/api/booking/hotels/:hotelId/settings/room-filters`                        |
| Frontend client target | `updateBookingRoomFilterSettings(input) -> BookingRoomFilterSettings`       |
| Legacy write path      | `PATCH /admin/settings/design` via `settingsService.updateDesignSettings()` |

```ts
type UpdateBookingRoomFilterSettingsRequest = {
  params: { hotelId: string };
  query: Record<string, never>;
  body: {
    bookingFilters: string[];
    customFilters: Record<string, string>;
    filterRooms: Record<string, string[]>;
  };
};

type BookingRoomFilterSettings = {
  bookingFilters: string[];
  customFilters: Record<string, string>;
  filterRooms: Record<string, string[]>;
};
```

Validation and behavior:

- All three fields are required and replace the full room-filter settings
  surface.
- Filter keys are trimmed strings and must not be empty. The route preserves
  key spelling after trimming.
- `bookingFilters` preserves order and may contain built-in filter keys or
  custom filter keys.
- `customFilters` maps custom filter keys to owner-typed display labels.
  Labels are trimmed and must not be empty.
- `filterRooms` maps filter keys to PMS room ids. Room ids are trimmed strings
  and must not be empty.
- Keys in `customFilters` and `filterRooms` that are not present in
  `bookingFilters` are invalid. This prevents hidden stale assignments from
  being written by the typed route.
- The route does not synchronously validate PMS room ids against PMS inventory;
  stale room ids can still be returned by the read contract and resolved by the
  UI fallback.
- Disabling filters is represented by:

```json
{
  "bookingFilters": [],
  "customFilters": {},
  "filterRooms": {}
}
```

Hero image, heading, subtext, colors, and font pairing remain on the legacy
design settings endpoint until a separate design-settings contract exists.

## Deferred Legacy Surfaces

The following writes intentionally remain legacy after this contract:

| Surface                                   | Reason                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add-on CRUD                               | Product item management, not add-on display settings.                  |
| Promo-code CRUD                           | Separate Booking Flow tab with a different domain contract.            |
| Last-minute configuration                 | Not part of the migrated read contract batch.                          |
| Header default-currency switcher          | Shares localization fields but is not the Booking Flow tab workflow.   |
| Setup-wizard localization/property writes | Setup owns hotel creation and broader property initialization.         |
| Hero/branding design settings             | Broad design surface, distinct from room-filter settings.              |
| Backend legacy endpoint removal           | Removal waits until booking-admin and any other consumers are audited. |

These deferred writes need their own Linear tickets and contracts before they
move off legacy admin endpoints.

## Implementation Notes

- Backend implementation should add a `BookingSettingsWriteRepository`
  interface next to the existing read repository instead of writing SQL from
  React-facing route handlers.
- Route tests should cover success, validation failure, missing/invalid auth,
  missing permission, missing entitlement, inactive entitlement, missing linked
  resource, not found, and write-model failure.
- Frontend clients should live under `apps/booking-admin/services/api/` and
  mirror the existing typed read-client error mapping style.
- Booking-admin save migration should replace legacy writes one surface at a
  time and keep production-mode e2e assertions for the affected tab.
- Legacy `settingsService` methods should only be removed after all migrated
  Booking Flow read and write consumers are gone.
