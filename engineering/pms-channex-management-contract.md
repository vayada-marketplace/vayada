# PMS Channex management contract

_VAY-1285 contract record. Builds on `channex-webhook-cutover-plan.md`,
`jobs-events-contract.md`, and the PMS-owned channel tables in
`target-schema-ownership-map.md`._

## Boundary

PMS owns Channex connection, provisioning, mappings, connected-channel state,
markups, manual synchronization, messaging installation, and iframe access.
The platform jobs/audit layer owns durable command delivery, attempts, retries,
dead letters, and audit correlation.

This contract does not receive or promote provider webhooks. VAY-844 owns
webhook subscription policy, VAY-845 owns booking-receipt promotion, and VAY-947
owns callback cutover.

## Authorization

Every route is protected with `enforceRoutePolicy`.

- Reads require `pms.operations.read`.
- Commands require `pms.operations.manage`.
- Both require an active `pms:property-management` entitlement and a linked
  `pms_property` resource for the requested property.
- Allowed relationships are `owner`, `operator`, and `front_desk`.

The denial matrix is missing/invalid auth (`401`), missing permission, missing
entitlement, inactive entitlement, and missing linked resource (`403`).

## HTTP surface

All responses carry `contractVersion: "pms-channex-management.v1"`.

| Method | Path                                                              | Purpose                                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/channex`                         | Complete management snapshot                                |
| `GET`  | `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/channex/operations/:operationId` | Durable operation progress/failure                          |
| `POST` | `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/channex/commands`                | Enable, disable, provision, sync, or install messaging      |
| `PUT`  | `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/channex/markups`                 | Replace channel markups and enqueue provider reconciliation |
| `POST` | `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/channex/iframe-session`          | Create a short-lived provider iframe session                |

Commands require `commandId` and `idempotencyKey`. A repeated key with the same
request fingerprint returns the existing operation. A repeated key with a
different fingerprint returns `409 idempotency_conflict`.

## Read model

The snapshot is composed only from target PMS and platform tables:

- `pms.channel_connections` for connection and messaging-install state;
- `pms.channel_room_type_mappings` and `pms.channel_rate_plan_mappings`;
- `pms.channel_sync_status` for booking, ARI, mapping, and message health;
- connection metadata for the last provider-confirmed connected-channel cache;
- `platform.jobs`, attempts, and dead letters for current command progress.

Provider reads refresh target state through a command/job or the iframe flow;
the browser never calls Channex directly. A disconnected property returns a
successful empty snapshot.

## Durable operations

Provider-affecting commands enqueue one job in `pms.channex.management` with a
stable key:

```text
channex.management:<operationType>:property:<propertyId>:<idempotencyKey>:v1
```

The route returns `202` after the job and product audit record commit. Workers
claim jobs with leases, append `platform.job_attempts`, and update the PMS
connection/sync read model only after provider success. Retryable timeouts,
`429`, and `5xx` responses use exponential backoff for at most five attempts.
Invalid state/payload and provider rejection are non-retryable. Exhausted or
non-retryable jobs create `platform.dead_letter_events` and an audit-visible
failure outcome.

Retained room-availability writes are reconciled from storage before another
room/date can be claimed. Reconciliation derives the property from the current
worker lease, processes at most ten oldest clean receipts per continuation, and
performs no provider read for missing or non-clean receipt evidence.
After pricing uploads are current, each unrestricted ARI continuation sends at
most one current room/date availability value. Its retained receipt schedules
the next bounded continuation; restrictions-only jobs do not enter this lane.

Manual ARI and booking sync are commands, not inline work. Booking sync wakes
the pull/feed-owned ingestion path; it does not implement webhook receipt
promotion. Markup changes persist target PMS state and enqueue provisioning/ARI
reconciliation under the same operation.

## Cutover guard

Each command capability is configured as `observe_only` or `mutating`.
`observe_only` keeps reads and operation history available but rejects new
provider mutations with `409 channex_capability_not_mutating`. Target mutation
may be enabled only after the matching VAY-788 legacy route group is
`target-owned` or disabled and the relevant legacy scheduler is frozen.

The snapshot exposes effective capability modes so the PMS UI and rehearsal
evidence do not infer ownership from deployment names.
