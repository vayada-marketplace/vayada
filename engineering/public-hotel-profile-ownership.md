# Public Hotel Profile and Location Ownership

_VAY-658 decision record. Builds on VAY-604, VAY-612, VAY-642,
VAY-655, and the target schema ownership map._

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical owner for public hotel identity, profile,
location, locale, currency, timezone, media, amenities, and public policy fields.
It exists so GEO, booking pages, marketplace pages, public AI/bookability APIs,
and Channex-facing PMS sync do not each invent their own hotel profile truth.

This is a contract document. It does not migrate production data or implement
new API routes.

## Decision

Canonical public hotel identity and location belong to the
**Hotel/property catalog** (`domain-hotels`).

The PMS is a producer of operational and setup facts, and Vayada PMS is one PMS
implementation among several. PMS and Channex data may seed or update catalog
fields through explicit mappings, but PMS and Channex-shaped payloads are not
the public profile contract.

Distribution (`domain-distribution`) consumes the hotel catalog read model plus
Booking, PMS, Finance, and booking-web inputs to create public bookability
profiles, structured data, public AI endpoints, and partner/tool feeds. It must
not expose product-native database fields or provider-shaped payloads.

### Marketplace Free-Form Location Deprecation

Marketplace `location` strings are migration evidence and marketplace display
overlays, not the canonical structured location after catalog rollout.

Deprecation lifecycle:

1. Preserve the raw free-form value on marketplace-owned records for audit,
   existing UI compatibility, and manual reconciliation.
2. Parse into catalog `country`, `region`, `city`, address, or geo fields only
   when confidence is high or an owner/admin confirms the mapped value.
3. When parsing is ambiguous, leave canonical structured fields null and expose
   a profile-completeness reason instead of publishing guessed structured
   location.
4. After catalog-backed consumers are live, marketplace search/display should
   read catalog structured location plus marketplace overlay text instead of
   treating `location` as canonical.

## Locale, Currency, and Timezone Rules

- **Timezone**: catalog-owned, IANA-only, required for quote semantics. Unknown
  timezone blocks public quote responses that depend on dates, same-day cutoff,
  or freshness windows. Do not default to UTC for public bookability.
- **Locale**: catalog owns default/supported content locales; Distribution may
  serve fallback text but must report the locale actually used. Hreflang should
  include only public pages that exist.
- **Currency**: Finance owns payment/currency capability, while Booking consumes
  it for quote and checkout. Public quote requests with unsupported currency
  fail clearly instead of silently converting through an unapproved path.

## Channex Boundary

Channex is PMS/channel connectivity. It requires property, room, rate, address,
currency, timezone, and mapping data, but those requirements do not make Channex
the owner of public hotel profile facts.

### Channex Adapter Input Map

| Channex-facing input                                      | Canonical owner        | Mapping rule                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Property title/name                                       | Hotel/property catalog | Map from public display name; PMS adapter may transform to provider limits.                                                      |
| Property type/category                                    | Hotel/property catalog | Map normalized catalog category where available; omit or use adapter default only when Channex requires it.                      |
| Country, region, city, postal code, street address        | Hotel/property catalog | Use structured catalog location fields; do not parse marketplace free-form location inside the Channex adapter.                  |
| Latitude/longitude                                        | Hotel/property catalog | Use verified catalog geo fields only; omit if incomplete or not public/approved for provider use.                                |
| Timezone                                                  | Hotel/property catalog | Use catalog IANA timezone; block provider setup if missing.                                                                      |
| Currency                                                  | Finance                | Use Finance-owned property currency/payment capability; PMS room/rate currencies must be reconciled to this before channel sync. |
| Public contact                                            | Hotel/property catalog | Public contact comes from catalog field-level public contact.                                                                    |
| Channel operations contact                                | PMS operations         | Operational channel contact remains PMS-private.                                                                                 |
| Room type identity, occupancy, room-level amenities/media | PMS operations         | PMS owns operational room/rate product; only public-safe room facts may feed Distribution snapshots.                             |
| Rate plan identity, restrictions, ARI values              | PMS operations         | PMS owns rate plans, rate rules, inventory, restrictions, and ARI sync.                                                          |
| Channex property/room/rate/channel mapping IDs            | PMS operations         | Private provider mapping state; never part of public profile or public bookability schema.                                       |
| Credentials, webhook payloads, sync errors, retries       | PMS operations         | Private operational state; jobs/events/audit may store receipts and attempts; Distribution may consume normalized reason codes.  |

Allowed flow:

```text
Hotel/property catalog public facts
  -> PMS/channel adapter maps required setup fields
  -> Channex property/room/rate/channel payloads
```

Forbidden flow:

```text
Channex payload or PMS channel mapping
  -> public hotel profile / structured data / AI bookability schema
```

Distribution may expose public-safe readiness like `channel_setup_incomplete`
only when it is expressed as a normalized reason code. It must not expose
Channex credentials, channel IDs, mapping IDs, raw webhook payloads, or sync
error traces.

## Consumer Contract

- **Booking-web public pages** consume `property_public_profile_read_model` and
  Distribution URL/bookability outputs. They should not call PMS or Marketplace
  profile tables directly for public identity.
- **Marketplace and landing** consume catalog public profile facts and add their
  own marketplace/listing overlays where needed.
- **Public AI/bookability APIs** consume Distribution projections from VAY-665,
  not Booking/PMS/Marketplace response shapes.
- **PMS admin and channel sync** consume catalog identity/location facts for
  setup, but PMS remains owner only for operational inventory, room/rate,
  reservation, and channel connectivity state.

## Follow-Up Implementation Dependencies

- VAY-665 must build the Distribution public bookability projection from this
  catalog ownership contract.
- VAY-661 and VAY-662 must expose public AI profile/quote data from the
  Distribution projection, not raw producer shapes.
- VAY-663 must own canonical URL/custom-domain policy using catalog slug/domain
  facts.
- VAY-666 tracks target catalog DDL and legacy Booking/PMS/Marketplace
  profile/location backfill.
