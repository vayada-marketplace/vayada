# Booking/PMS Coupling Audit

_VAY-642 audit record. This document inventories existing Booking, PMS,
Marketplace, Auth, and Channex coupling so the TypeScript rewrite can preserve
the intended product split without copying legacy integration shortcuts._

## Purpose

Vayada wants Booking Engine, PMS, Marketplace, and related platform domains to
stay interchangeable. Vayada PMS must be one PMS implementation behind stable
contracts, not the private backend for Vayada Booking Engine.

This audit covers current legacy runtime coupling across the Python APIs and
Booking Web clients. It does not refactor legacy services, change database
topology, add import-boundary tooling, or define the PMS sink contract. Those
belong to follow-up tickets and the existing architecture records.

## Classification Rules

Each coupling is classified by the target owner from
`engineering/target-schema-ownership-map.md`:

- Booking/checkout: guest-facing quote, checkout, direct-booking lifecycle,
  guest-visible status, cancellation, and change requests.
- PMS operations: rooms, room types, inventory, operational reservations, room
  assignment, check-in/out, and channel connectivity.
- Distribution/bookability: public-safe availability, quote, and bookability
  snapshots.
- Finance: payment settings, payments, payouts, commissions, billing, and
  entitlements.
- Identity/auth: users, organizations, memberships, resource links,
  permissions, and RequestContext.
- Hotel catalog: canonical property identity, profile, contact, location,
  media, amenities, and setup facts.
- Jobs/events/audit: durable jobs, outbox events, retries, sync health, audit,
  and notification delivery.

Target disposition means:

- Keep as migration input: acceptable source data for parity/backfill only.
- Replace with read model/interface: target runtime may consume a typed
  contract, not another product's raw tables.
- Remove from target path: do not copy this integration shape into TypeScript.

## Executive Summary

The TypeScript Booking target path is currently cleaner than the legacy Python
apps: `apps/api/src` exposes an optional `BOOKING_DATABASE_URL` and the Booking
reservation route depends on a repository interface, not PMS tables or Channex
symbols.

The highest-risk legacy couplings are elsewhere:

- PMS API owns guest-facing direct booking routes and checkout behavior while
  also writing PMS operational booking rows.
- Booking Web calls PMS public APIs directly for rooms, unavailable dates,
  payment settings, affiliate clicks, and booking lifecycle operations.
- PMS reads and writes Booking Engine hotel/payment/add-on settings through
  `BookingEngineDatabase`.
- Booking API dashboards and billing quote logic read PMS operational tables
  directly.
- Marketplace collaboration acceptance writes PMS affiliate records directly.
- Channex side effects and guest/host notifications are fired from request-path
  code instead of durable job/event boundaries.
- Product auth still relies on shared `auth-db.users.type`, `is_superadmin`,
  direct `user_id` ownership, and `X-Hotel-Id` shortcuts.

These are acceptable current-system facts and migration inputs. They must not
be treated as target architecture.

runtime patterns:

## Channex Boundary Notes

Channex remains PMS-owned in the target architecture because it distributes
availability, rates, restrictions, and OTA reservations to a PMS-style system.
The risky part is not that PMS talks to Channex. The risky part is request-path
code combining Channex sync, Booking settings reads, notification delivery,
payout side effects, and PMS booking mutation in one flow.

Target Channex shape:

- PMS adapter owns Channex property, room, rate, availability, restriction, and
  channel booking mappings.
- Inbound Channex revisions produce PMS operational reservation events and, when
  guest-visible state is needed, Booking-domain booking events.
- ARI pushes, retries, webhook processing, notification delivery, and audit
  entries move through jobs/events with idempotency keys and retry visibility.
- Booking Engine does not import Channex code, mention Channex route contracts,
  or require Channex IDs except as opaque external references exposed by a PMS
  integration contract.

## Removal and Replacement Order

1. Preserve the TypeScript Booking guardrail: no `PMS_DATABASE_URL`, Channex
   symbols, PMS table names, or PMS implementation imports in Booking route
   adapters.
2. Move Booking Web public flows behind Booking/distribution APIs instead of
   direct PMS public API calls.
3. Land the PMS reservation sink contract and route direct booking creation
   through a Booking-owned handoff instead of PMS public checkout routes.
4. Split guest booking state from operational reservation state. Booking owns
   guest-visible lifecycle and change requests; PMS owns assignments,
   check-in/out, operational notes, and channel mapping state.
5. Replace PMS `BookingEngineDatabase` reads/writes for hotel identity, payment
   settings, add-ons, terms, billing, and commissions with catalog, finance,
   distribution, and booking read models or commands.
6. Replace Booking API PMS dashboard and billing reads with curated metrics and
   entitlement snapshots.
7. Replace Marketplace-to-PMS affiliate writes with an event/service boundary.
8. Replace fire-and-forget Channex/email/payout side effects with durable
   jobs/events and audit records.
9. Replace product auth shortcuts and product-owned Auth DB writes with
   WorkOS-backed user-lifecycle commands, RequestContext,
   organization memberships, resource links, permissions, and entitlement read
   models.
10. Retire legacy cross-product database URL wiring after the TypeScript target
    path has equivalent read models, commands, parity coverage, and rollout
    gates.

## Recommended Follow-Up Tickets

Existing related tickets already cover part of the removal plan:

| VAY-656: Move product-owned Auth DB writes behind identity user-lifecycle commands  | Prevents Booking, Marketplace, and PMS product flows from mutating identity tables directly.                                                                                                                                                                               | C11               |

The legacy product auth shortcut risk is covered by VAY-608 RequestContext
direction, identity-schema follow-up work such as VAY-616, and VAY-656 for
product-owned Auth DB writes.

## Acceptance for Future PRs

Any future implementation PR touching booking, PMS, availability, Channex,
payments, or tenant/auth boundaries should answer these review questions:

- Does the change preserve Vayada PMS as one interchangeable PMS adapter?
- Is every cross-domain read represented as a read model or interface, not a raw
  table or legacy database pool?
- Is every cross-domain write represented as a command/event with idempotency
  and audit when it affects bookings, inventory, payments, or channel sync?
- Are migration/backfill scripts clearly separated from target runtime code?
- Did an independent subagent adversarial review run before PR finalization?
