# Next-stack legacy dependency inventory

VAY-880 inventory for the TypeScript rewrite next stack.

This complements:

- [apps-api legacy runtime dependency audit](apps-api-legacy-runtime-dependency-audit.md)
- [booking/PMS route migration inventory](booking-pms-route-migration-inventory.md)
- [marketplace route migration inventory](marketplace-route-migration-inventory.md)
- [RequestContext contract](request-context-contract.md)

## Scope

Audited next-stack surfaces:

- `next-api` (`apps/api`)
- `next-pms` (`apps/pms-web`)
- `next-booking-admin` (`apps/booking-admin`)
- `next-booking` (`apps/booking-web`)
- `next-admin` (`apps/vayada-admin`)
- `next-marketplace` (`apps/marketplace-web`)
- `next-affiliate` (`apps/affiliate-dashboard`)

Out of scope for this inventory: changing customer-facing normal production
routes, deleting compatibility code, or migrating callers. This document records
what still depends on legacy shapes and what proof is needed before deletion.

## Summary

The next-stack debt falls into four groups:

1. `apps/api` still defaults several source selectors to legacy/disabled modes
   and still reads legacy service URLs/database URLs.
2. Admin frontends still rely on old `/admin/*`, `/super-admin/*`, and direct
   legacy service clients, often scoped by `X-Hotel-Id`.
3. Several compatibility adapters intentionally return fake/no-op data so next
   route smoke can render before target contracts exist.
4. Smoke coverage catches selected migrated routes, but there is no global
   no-legacy-call guard yet, and Booking Admin shell mocks still allow broad
   `/admin/**` traffic.

## Inventory

1. **`next-api`: legacy source defaults and runtime envs**

   - **Old thing:** `apps/api/src/config.ts` still defaults multiple selectors
     to legacy or disabled modes and reads legacy runtime envs:
     `PUBLIC_HOTEL_PROFILE_SOURCE=legacy`, `BOOKING_*_SOURCE=legacy`,
     `PMS_OPERATIONS_SOURCE=disabled`, `FINANCE_SOURCE=legacy`,
     `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `PMS_API_URL`, and the
     legacy checkout proxy flag (lines 306-468). The concrete legacy product
     runtime envs are `BOOKING_DATABASE_URL`,
     `BOOKING_RESERVATIONS_READ_DATABASE_URL`, `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL`,
     `PMS_API_URL`, and `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL` (lines 424-457).
   - **Current consumer:** all next frontends using target API routes.
   - **Target replacement:** target-schema repositories and source flags set to
     `target`, with legacy product DB/API envs unset for migrated route groups.
   - **Owner domain:** platform plus owning product domains.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** a repeatable boot/route check proves
     migrated route groups do not instantiate legacy repos or HTTP clients.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-882 plus VAY-760 follow-ups.

2. **`next-api`: auth compatibility bridge**

   - **Old thing:** `/auth/compat/*-token` routes mint short-lived legacy JWTs
     for platform admin, Booking Admin, PMS Web, and Affiliate Dashboard
     (`apps/api/src/routes/authSession.ts` lines 393-570), backed by
     `AUTH_LEGACY_MARKETPLACE_JWT_SECRET`, `AUTH_LEGACY_BOOKING_JWT_SECRET`,
     `AUTH_LEGACY_PMS_JWT_SECRET`, and
     `AUTH_LEGACY_AFFILIATE_PMS_JWT_SECRET` (`apps/api/src/config.ts` lines
     241-250).
   - **Current consumer:** `booking-admin`, `pms-web`, `affiliate-dashboard`,
     and some admin/marketplace compatibility flows.
   - **Target replacement:** AuthKit session plus typed
     `RequestContext`/route-policy authorization; no legacy JWT secret per
     migrated surface.
   - **Owner domain:** WorkOS / Identity.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** each frontend proves normal flows use
     AuthKit/RequestContext tokens directly and no migrated request calls
     `/auth/compat/*`.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-878, VAY-883, VAY-886, WorkOS surface cutover tickets.

3. **Cross-surface scope: `X-Hotel-Id`**

   - **Old thing:** `X-Hotel-Id` as routing scope
     (`apps/booking-admin/services/api/client.ts` lines 86-90;
     `apps/pms-web/services/api/client.ts` lines 81-85;
     `apps/vayada-admin/services/api/bookingClient.ts` lines 7-8;
     `apps/api/src/routes/pmsOperations.ts` lines 2100-2119).
   - **Current consumer:** Booking Admin, PMS Web, Platform Admin booking
     settings calls, Ask Intelligence calls.
   - **Target replacement:** explicit resource ids in typed route paths or
     request bodies, authorized through `RequestContext.linkedResources` and
     route policy.
   - **Owner domain:** platform auth plus product domains.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** browser smoke and route tests show
     migrated calls no longer send `X-Hotel-Id` as the trust boundary.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-878, VAY-883, VAY-885, VAY-881.

4. **`next-pms`: direct PMS and marketplace legacy clients**

   - **Old thing:** direct PMS API client fallback
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_PMS_API_URL || "https://api.pms.localhost"` and handoff
     fallback `https://pms-api.vayada.com`
     (`apps/pms-web/services/api/pmsClient.ts` lines 1-7;
     `apps/pms-web/app/handoff/page.tsx` lines 52-91). PMS Web also calls broad
     legacy admin route families for financials, import, messaging, rooms,
     room-types, module activations, Channex, bookings, calendar, settings,
     payment/Stripe, and room blocks (`apps/pms-web/services/financials/index.ts`
     lines 116-143; `apps/pms-web/services/import/index.ts` lines 47-50;
     `apps/pms-web/services/messaging/index.ts` lines 59-114;
     `apps/pms-web/services/rooms/index.ts` lines 367-417). Image upload can
     still fall back to the legacy marketplace API
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_API_URL || "https://api.vayada.com"` with
     `X-Hotel-Id` (`apps/pms-web/services/upload/index.ts` lines 6-7 and 105).
   - **Current consumer:** PMS Web setup, settings, calendar, bookings, channel
     manager, rooms, financials, import, messaging, media upload, and handoff.
   - **Target replacement:** typed PMS operations routes for rooms/calendar/
     messaging/operational reservations; finance contracts for invoices,
     payments, payouts, payment settings, and Stripe/Xendit; platform media
     upload/import contracts for images and listing imports; Channex target
     intake/cutover contracts for channel connectivity.
   - **Owner domain:** PMS operations / finance / platform media / channel
     connectivity.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** PMS Web smoke records no old PMS host,
     no legacy marketplace upload host, no `/admin/*` helper routes for migrated
     surfaces, and no `X-Hotel-Id` upload scope.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-878 for next-stack PMS helper migration; VAY-770 and
     implementation slices VAY-775-VAY-784 for PMS operations; VAY-795 and
     VAY-810-VAY-815 for finance; VAY-806 and VAY-820-VAY-827 for platform
     media/import; VAY-772 and VAY-785-VAY-794 for Channex/webhooks.

5. **`next-api`: PMS legacy admin adapters**

   - **Old thing:** `registerPmsLegacyAdminRoutes` registers PMS-shaped
     `/admin/*` helpers and fake/no-op values for unread count, payment
     settings, Channex status/channels, and calendar settings
     (`apps/api/src/routes/pmsOperations.ts` lines 1775-2098).
   - **Current consumer:** PMS Web while it still calls admin-shaped endpoints.
   - **Target replacement:** typed `/api/pms/properties/:propertyId/*`
     read/command contracts.
   - **Owner domain:** PMS operations / finance / channel connectivity.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** PMS Web migrates first; API tests
     prove typed routes still cover the real contracts.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-879 after VAY-878.

6. **`next-booking-admin`: backend helper facade**

   - **Old thing:** `bookingAdminCompat` registers Booking Admin `/admin/*`
     helpers with zeroed dashboards, empty modules/add-ons/promo codes, fake
     custom-domain status, and 501 writes
     (`apps/api/src/routes/bookingAdminCompat.ts` lines 71-258).
   - **Current consumer:** Booking Admin dashboard, design/settings, modules,
     custom domain, add-ons, promo codes, setup.
   - **Target replacement:** typed Booking settings, dashboard/read-model, hotel
     catalog, domain verification, and finance contracts.
   - **Owner domain:** Booking / finance / platform events.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** Booking Admin no longer calls these
     helper paths, and unavailable features render explicit disabled states
     instead of fake success.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-883, then VAY-884.

7. **`next-booking-admin`: settings and setup calls**

   - **Old thing:** Booking Admin service still calls old `/admin/hotels`,
     `/admin/superadmin/hotels`, `/admin/settings/property`,
     `/admin/settings/setup-status`, `/admin/addons`, `/admin/promo-codes`, and
     custom-domain paths (`apps/booking-admin/services/settings/index.ts` lines
     240-348). Setup wizard posts PMS `/admin/register-hotel`,
     `/admin/room-types`, `/admin/payment-settings`, and `/admin/hotel`
     (`apps/booking-admin/app/setup/page.tsx` lines 366-480).
   - **Current consumer:** Booking Admin setup, settings, design studio, booking
     flow.
   - **Target replacement:** typed Booking setup/catalog/settings contracts, PMS
     room setup contracts, and finance payment-setting contracts.
   - **Owner domain:** Booking / PMS operations / finance.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** saves persist through target routes or
     fail visibly; target gaps are linked instead of hidden behind helper
     facades.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-883; missing domain contracts should become owner
     tickets if VAY-883 cannot implement them.

8. **`next-booking-admin`: direct PMS service client**

   - **Old thing:** Booking Admin has its own direct PMS service client
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_PMS_URL || "https://api.pms.localhost"`
     (`apps/booking-admin/services/api/pmsClient.ts` lines 1-8). It backs
     affiliate admin routes, module activations, setup PMS registration/room
     creation, payment settings, Stripe onboarding, and room-type lookups
     (`apps/booking-admin/services/affiliates/index.ts` lines 47-72;
     `apps/booking-admin/services/api/moduleActivationClient.ts` lines 34-45;
     `apps/booking-admin/app/setup/page.tsx` lines 392-480;
     `apps/booking-admin/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` lines 279-299 and
     495-496).
   - **Current consumer:** Booking Admin affiliate management, feature modules,
     setup wizard, settings payment/Stripe sections, and room lookup helpers.
   - **Target replacement:** typed Booking Admin/settings contracts for modules
     and setup state, typed PMS operations contracts for rooms and PMS setup,
     affiliate/marketplace contracts for affiliate administration, and finance
     contracts for payment/Stripe behavior.
   - **Owner domain:** Booking / PMS operations / affiliate / finance.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** Booking Admin smoke records no
     `NEXT_PUBLIC_PMS_URL` old-host fallback and no PMS `/admin/*` calls for
     migrated Booking Admin surfaces; affiliate/payment gaps are linked to their
     domain owner tickets.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-883 for Booking Admin helper migration, VAY-770/VAY-795
     for PMS/finance contracts, and VAY-886/A1 affiliate follow-ups for
     affiliate-owned target routes.

9. **`next-booking-admin`: Ask Intelligence scope header**

   - **Old thing:** Ask client sends `X-Hotel-Id` while also sending
     organization scope (`apps/booking-admin/services/api/askIntelligenceClient.ts`
     lines 71-85).
   - **Current consumer:** Booking Admin Ask Intelligence panel.
   - **Target replacement:** Ask request scope derived from AuthKit organization
     plus authorized booking/PMS resource context.
   - **Owner domain:** Ask Intelligence / auth.
   - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** Ask route tests reject mismatched
     resource scope and frontend no longer treats a client header as authority.
   - **Follow-up:** VAY-887; include in VAY-881 banlist when migrated.

10. **`next-booking`: public API base fallback**

- **Old thing:** Booking Web public client defaults to
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_WEB_API_URL || "https://api.localhost"`
  (`apps/booking-web/services/api/client.ts` lines 81-85;
  `apps/booking-web/lib/server/publicHotelMetadata.ts` lines 72-78).
- **Current consumer:** Booking Web public hotel pages and metadata.
- **Target replacement:** explicit next-api public Booking Web base URL per
  environment.
- **Owner domain:** Booking Web / platform runtime config.
- **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** smoke records no legacy host fallback;
  production/staging envs pin next-api.
- **Follow-up:** VAY-881, VAY-882.

11. **`next-api`: Booking Web public compatibility adapter**

    - **Old thing:** checkout/status/lookup/guest command routes still proxy to
      `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL`; promo/domain still use `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL`;
      writes require `BOOKING_WEB_LEGACY_CHECKOUT_COMMAND_PROXY_ENABLED`
      (`apps/api/src/routes/bookingWebPublic.ts` lines 1305-1457 and
      2368-2423).
    - **Current consumer:** Booking Web checkout, promo validation,
      custom-domain resolution, guest lifecycle, affiliate public routes.
    - **Target replacement:** Booking checkout command handlers, target public
      bookability/domain projections, target affiliate/finance ownership.
    - **Owner domain:** Booking / PMS handoff / finance / affiliate.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** parity passes with
      `PMS_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `BOOKING_PUBLIC_API_URL`, and the legacy proxy flag
      absent.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-760 follow-ups: VAY-764, VAY-767, VAY-768, VAY-771.

12. **`next-admin`: direct legacy service clients**

    - **Old thing:** Platform Admin still has direct old service clients:
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_PMS_API_URL || "https://pms-api.vayada.com"`,
      `NEXT_PUBLIC_BOOKING_API_URL || "https://booking-api.vayada.com"`, and
      marketplace fallback `https://api.vayada.com`
      (`apps/vayada-admin/services/api/pmsClient.ts` lines 1-5;
      `apps/vayada-admin/services/api/bookingClient.ts` lines 1-8;
      `apps/vayada-admin/services/api/marketplace.ts` lines 1-7).
    - **Current consumer:** Platform Admin KPI/property actions, Booking
      settings admin, affiliate payouts, marketplace reads/writes.
    - **Target replacement:** typed `next-api` platform-admin, booking-admin,
      finance, and marketplace-admin clients.
    - **Owner domain:** platform / booking / finance / marketplace.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** browser smoke proves `next-admin` no
      longer calls old service hostnames for migrated surfaces.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-885.

13. **`next-admin`: old admin route shapes**

    - **Old thing:** Platform Admin still calls Booking `/admin/superadmin/*`,
      `/admin/settings/*`, `/admin/addons`, `/admin/promo-codes`, PMS
      `/super-admin/affiliate-payouts`, and legacy marketplace profile writes
      (`apps/vayada-admin/services/booking/settingsService.ts` lines 112-188;
      `apps/vayada-admin/services/api/affiliatePayouts.ts` lines 90-101;
      `apps/vayada-admin/services/api/users.ts` lines 86-169).
    - **Current consumer:** Platform Admin hotel/user/profile/finance
      administration.
    - **Target replacement:** platform admin contracts, marketplace admin
      profile/listing contracts, finance payout contracts, explicit platform
      permissions.
    - **Owner domain:** platform / marketplace / finance.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** migrated admin flows no longer use
      `/admin/*` or `/super-admin/*`; any missing target contract is linked to
      an owner.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-885, VAY-795, marketplace admin vertical tickets.

14. **`next-api`: marketplace admin superadmin fallback**

    - **Old thing:** Marketplace admin routes include opt-in
      `users.is_superadmin` fallback during platform org migration
      (`apps/api/src/routes/marketplaceAdmin.ts` lines 11-31 and 635-654).
    - **Current consumer:** Platform/marketplace admin collaboration and
      hotel-listing management.
    - **Target replacement:** platform organization membership and permissions
      only.
    - **Owner domain:** WorkOS / marketplace admin.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:**
      `MARKETPLACE_ADMIN_LEGACY_SUPERADMIN_FALLBACK_ENABLED` is off in migrated
      envs and tests cover the denial matrix.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-882; marketplace admin vertical tickets.

15. **`next-affiliate`: PMS-owned dashboard API**

    - **Old thing:** Affiliate Dashboard API defaults to
      `https://api.pms.localhost`, types mirror the PMS backend, and auth mints
      `/auth/compat/affiliate-dashboard-token`
      (`apps/affiliate-dashboard/services/api/client.ts` lines 1-13;
      `apps/affiliate-dashboard/services/auth/index.ts` lines 15-60;
      `apps/affiliate-dashboard/services/auth/storage.ts` lines 94-99).
    - **Current consumer:** affiliate dashboard, properties, earnings, activity,
      payouts, payout settings, bank validation.
    - **Target replacement:** target affiliate/marketplace reads plus finance
      payout/provider contracts, authorized by AuthKit/RequestContext.
    - **Owner domain:** affiliate / finance / WorkOS.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** `next-affiliate` smoke records no PMS
      host, PMS-shaped `/affiliate/*` legacy calls, or compat-token dependency
      for migrated routes.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-886.

16. **`next-marketplace`: compatibility methods and auth base**

    - **Old thing:** Marketplace Web still has legacy compatibility
      methods/comments for hotel CRUD and collaboration fallback; auth base
      defaults to `https://api.localhost`; PMS app switcher links default to
      production PMS (`apps/marketplace-web/services/api/hotels.ts` lines
      269-289; `apps/marketplace-web/services/api/collaborations.ts` lines
      386-400; `apps/marketplace-web/services/auth/auth.ts` lines 19-22;
      `apps/marketplace-web/lib/constants/routes.ts` lines 73-77).
    - **Current consumer:** Marketplace Web hotel/creator surfaces and product
      navigation.
    - **Target replacement:** marketplace vertical contracts, WorkOS auth
      cutover, and configured product URLs.
    - **Owner domain:** marketplace / WorkOS.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** migrated marketplace surfaces use
      typed marketplace clients and no legacy auth or CRUD fallback methods.
      Product navigation URLs are config, not runtime API dependencies.
    - **Follow-up:** existing marketplace vertical tickets from
      VAY-737/VAY-803/VAY-801.

17. **Smoke/proof layer: broad admin mocks**

    - **Old thing:** shared Booking Admin mocks still fulfill broad
      `**/admin/**`, while focused tests assert only selected migrated routes
      (`tests/e2e/support/bookingAdminMocks.ts` lines 123-161).
    - **Current consumer:** E2E smoke for next frontends.
    - **Target replacement:** data-driven no-legacy-call guard per migrated
      surface.
    - **Owner domain:** DX / platform verification.
    - **Deletion blocker / proof needed:** guard fails with the offending request
      URL/method when a migrated surface calls banned hosts, route shapes,
      headers, or compatibility endpoints.
    - **Follow-up:** VAY-881.

## Follow-up owner map
