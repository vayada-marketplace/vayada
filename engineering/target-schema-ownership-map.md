# Target schema ownership map

_VAY-609 contract record. Builds on VAY-600, VAY-602, VAY-603, VAY-605,
VAY-607, and VAY-608._

## Purpose

This document converts the VAY-605 database restructure plan into a table-level
ownership map for the planned target schema. It is not production DDL and does
not move data. Its job is to make later DDL and migration tickets answer one
review question at a time: which domain owns this table, which source data feeds
it, and which other domains may consume it.

The target schema should be built for Vayada's domain model, not for the current
auth/marketplace/booking/PMS database split. Current production databases remain
source of truth until the reviewed cutover window.

## Ownership Rules

- Every target table or read model has exactly one write owner.
- Other domains consume typed services, read models, or domain events.
- No TypeScript domain may open another domain's raw tables or legacy database
  pool as normal integration.
- Legacy authorization shortcuts such as `X-Hotel-Id`, `users.type`,
  `users.is_superadmin`, and direct product `user_id` ownership are migration
  inputs only. They are not target tables, target authorization primitives, or
  TypeScript route contracts.
- External provider IDs are preserved where they are business-critical, but
  they do not replace Vayada internal IDs.
- Tables that expose public or AI-readable data must state their public/private
  posture before DDL is written.

## Topology Posture

Default planning posture: one physical target Postgres database with schemas per
domain:

```text
identity
catalog
booking
pms
marketplace
finance
distribution
intelligence
platform
```

This keeps the big-bang cutover operationally simpler while preserving explicit
domain ownership. If Vayada later chooses multiple physical databases, the
table ownership below should stay the contract and the migration harness must
prove the same parity and access boundaries across physical connections.

Open topology questions before DDL:

- Should audit and jobs live in one `platform` schema or separate `audit` and
  `jobs` schemas?
- Which tables need tenant-local sequences versus globally generated UUIDs?
- Should public bookability snapshots be regular tables, materialized views, or
  generated cache rows with explicit freshness metadata?
- Which target tables require row-level retention rules before production
  cutover?
- Which read models can be rebuilt from authoritative tables versus migrated
  directly from source snapshots?

## Target Owner Map

### Identity and Authorization

Owner package: `domain-identity` with infrastructure support from
`backend-auth` and `backend-authorization`.

| Target table or read model        | Owner                    | Source migration histories / current tables                                                                                     | Notes                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users`                           | Identity/auth            | `auth-db/migrations`: `users`; legacy marketplace `users` only as historical migration input if any rows remain.                | Preserve `users.id` as internal principal. No product `type` authorization.                  |
| `external_identities`             | Identity/auth            | WorkOS backfill plus `auth-db.users.email`; provider metadata.                                                                  | Maps WorkOS IDs to internal users.                                                           |
| `organizations`                   | Identity/auth            | Existing user ownership on booking hotels, PMS hotels, marketplace hotel profiles, creators, affiliates, and platform staff.    | Organization kinds: `platform`, `hotel_group`, `creator_workspace`, `affiliate_partner`.     |
| `organization_memberships`        | Identity/auth            | Existing owner/admin user associations, WorkOS memberships, migration transforms from `users.type` and `is_superadmin`.         | `users.type` and `is_superadmin` are transform inputs only.                                  |
| `permission_catalog`              | Identity/auth            | VAY-600/VAY-608 permission contract, not legacy tables.                                                                         | Stable permission keys such as `booking.settings.manage` and `platform.user.suspend`.        |
| `role_permission_grants`          | Identity/auth            | VAY-600 role model, WorkOS role slugs, product role decisions.                                                                  | Grants permissions by organization kind and role.                                            |
| `membership_permission_overrides` | Identity/auth            | Future admin exceptions.                                                                                                        | Optional; can be deferred until role grants are insufficient.                                |
| `organization_resource_links`     | Identity/auth            | `booking_hotels.user_id`, PMS `hotels.user_id`, marketplace `hotel_profiles.user_id`, `creators.user_id`, `affiliates.user_id`. | Links organizations to product resources. Direct `user_id` ownership is not carried forward. |
| `product_entitlements`            | Identity/auth read model | Finance-owned `billing_entitlements`, product module state, platform status.                                                    | RequestContext entitlement read model only; finance/product domains own upstream writes.     |
| `auth_reconciliation_events`      | Identity/auth            | WorkOS webhooks and migration/linking runs.                                                                                     | Provider reconciliation, not product audit.                                                  |
| `request_context_resource_scope`  | Identity/auth read model | `organization_memberships`, `permission_catalog`, `organization_resource_links`, entitlements.                                  | Read model for RequestContext resolution and tests.                                          |

Explicitly deferred or retired:

- `password_reset_tokens`, `email_verification_codes`,
  `email_verification_tokens`, `email_change_tokens`, `totp_secrets`,
  `totp_recovery_codes`, and `login_rate_limit` are not target active auth
  systems after WorkOS is authoritative. Retain source snapshots only for
  rollback/audit during the cutover window.
- `cookie_consent`, `consent_history`, and `gdpr_requests` remain Vayada-owned,
  but they belong to identity/privacy retention rather than provider auth.

## DDL Readiness Checklist

Before opening DDL tickets against this map:

- Each target table has an owner package and schema.
- Each migrated table has a source history and transform owner.
- Each public/read-model table has a public/private field posture.
- Each cross-domain consumer uses a read model, service, or event.
- Each retired source table has a retention/rollback disposition.
- Topology decision is recorded: one physical DB with schemas or multiple
  physical DBs cut over together.

## Follow-Up Tickets

- VAY-610 should use this map to design the migration/parity harness.
- DDL tickets should be split by owner domain and should not mix schema design,
  ETL implementation, and product route behavior in one PR.
- VAY-611 should use the owner package names here when deciding shared backend
  package boundaries.
